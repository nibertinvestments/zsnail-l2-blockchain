# Copilot Instructions for ZSnail L2 Blockchain Project

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

### â›” DO NOT ASSUME
**NEVER make assumptions about user intentions, project direction, or technical decisions without explicit confirmation.**
- Always ASK before suggesting architectural changes or technology switches
- Do NOT suggest replacing existing systems without user request
- Do NOT assume what infrastructure the user wants to implement
- ALWAYS clarify requirements before proceeding with research or implementation
- If uncertain about user goals, ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS before taking action

### PROJECT STATUS UPDATE - September 2025
**COMPLETED INFRASTRUCTURE**: ZSnail L2 now has a complete, production-ready blockchain ecosystem:
- **âœ… 16 Custom ZSnail Library Contracts**: Complete replacement of OpenZeppelin with L2-optimized implementations
- **âœ… 4 L2 Core Infrastructure Contracts**: Full optimistic rollup with fraud proofs, cross-layer bridge, and state management
- **âœ… Google Cloud Storage Integration**: All contracts stored exclusively in `gs://zsnail-blockchain-storage/contracts/`
- **âœ… Production Security**: Economic incentives, staking mechanisms, and challenge systems operational
- **âœ… 2025 Technology Stack**: Hardhat v3.0.6, Ethers v6.15.0, Node.js LTS 2025, zero vulnerabilities

### 2025 SOFTWARE STANDARDS
- **YEAR: 2025** - Always use the latest 2025 versions of all software, frameworks, and dependencies
- Use Node.js LTS 2025, npm 10+, and latest stable package versions to avoid deprecation warnings
- Avoid deprecated packages and legacy code patterns from 2024 and earlier
- Prioritize ES2025+ features and modern JavaScript/TypeScript syntax
- Use the latest versions of React 19+, Express.js 5+, and all major frameworks
- Update all dependencies to their 2025 stable releases to prevent compatibility issues
- Check package.json for deprecated warnings and update accordingly

### REAL PRODUCTION CODE ONLY
- **NO EXAMPLE CODE**: Do not use placeholder, example, or demonstration code
- **NO FAKE DATA**: All variables, URLs, addresses, and configuration must be real or left blank
- **NO MADE-UP VALUES**: Never use placeholder numbers, fake API keys, or dummy addresses
- **NO FAKE DEPENDENCIES**: Never install or reference packages that don't exist in npm registry
- **NO FAKE DIRECTORIES**: Only reference actual directories that exist in the project
- **ERROR-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT**: If something is missing, let it error so we can properly configure it
- **PRODUCTION-READY**: Every line of code must be production-quality and functional
- **NO LINT ERRORS ARE ACCEPTABLE**: Use best practices for everything - proper markdown formatting, correct syntax, professional standards at all times. Zero tolerance for any formatting issues, linting errors, or code quality problems.

### ZSNAIL CONTRACT ECOSYSTEM PRINCIPLES
- **CLOUD-ONLY STORAGE**: All smart contracts are stored exclusively in Google Cloud Storage
- **CUSTOM LIBRARY PRIORITY**: Always use ZSnail custom contracts instead of OpenZeppelin
- **GAS OPTIMIZATION**: Prioritize gas efficiency with individual contract deployments
- **L2 SPECIFIC**: All contracts are optimized for Layer 2 scaling and performance
- **SECURITY FIRST**: Production-ready security with fraud proofs and economic incentives

### CODE INTEGRITY RULES
1. **Real APIs Only**: Use actual service endpoints or leave blank for configuration
2. **Actual Dependencies**: Only include dependencies that are actually used
3. **Working Configurations**: All config files must be functional or explicitly marked as needing setup
4. **No Placeholders**: Remove any "your_key_here", "example.com", or similar placeholders
5. **Explicit Errors**: Prefer configuration errors over silent placeholder failures
