## 1. CORE GAS PRICING EQUATION

### Base Formula

```text
GasPriceZSNAIL = BaseFee + PriorityFee + CongestionMultiplier + OperationalCost
```

### Mathematical Definition

```text
P(t) = B + F(d) + C(u,t) + O(s)

Where:
- P(t) = Gas price at time t (in ZSNAIL)
- B = Base fee (constant)
- F(d) = Priority fee function based on demand
- C(u,t) = Congestion multiplier based on utilization and time
- O(s) = Operational cost based on system state
```

---

## 2. BASE FEE CALCULATION

### L2 Competitive Base Fee

```text
BaseFee = (InfrastructureCost / BlocksPerDay) * ProfitMargin * L2Discount

B = (IC / BPD) * PM * LD

Where:
- IC = Infrastructure cost per day (in USD)
- BPD = Blocks per day = 86400 / BlockTime = 86400 / 2 = 43,200
- PM = Profit margin (1.2 = 20% profit)
- LD = L2 discount factor (0.01 = 99% cheaper than L1)
```

### Current Values

```text
Infrastructure Cost = $100/day (Google Cloud)
Blocks Per Day = 43,200 (2-second blocks)
Base Cost Per Block = $100 / 43,200 = $0.0023 USD
L2 Target = $0.0023 * 0.01 = $0.000023 USD per block
At 12,500 ZSNAIL/USD = 0.2875 ZSNAIL base fee
```

#### Result: BaseFee = 0.29 ZSNAIL

## 3. PRIORITY FEE ALGORITHM

### Demand-Based Priority Pricing

```text
PriorityFee = MinPriority * (1 + DemandFactor^2)

F(d) = Fmin * (1 + (TPS_current / TPS_max)^2)

Where:
- Fmin = Minimum priority fee = 0.1 ZSNAIL
- TPS_current = Current transactions per second
- TPS_max = Maximum TPS capacity = 25,000
```

### Priority Fee Levels

```text
Low Congestion (0-40% capacity): F = 0.1 * (1 + 0.16) = 0.116 ZSNAIL
Medium Congestion (40-80%): F = 0.1 * (1 + 0.64) = 0.164 ZSNAIL
High Congestion (80-100%): F = 0.1 * (1 + 1.0) = 0.2 ZSNAIL
```

---

## 4. CONGESTION MULTIPLIER

### Dynamic Congestion Response

```text
CongestionMultiplier = 1 + (UtilizationRate^3 * TimeWeight)

C(u,t) = 1 + (u^3 * w(t))

Where:
- u = Block utilization (0-1)
- w(t) = Time weight function for peak hours
```

### Time Weight Function

```text
w(t) = 1.5 if peak hours (UTC 12-16, 20-24)
w(t) = 1.0 if normal hours
w(t) = 0.7 if low hours (UTC 4-8)
```

### Example Calculations

```text
Low utilization (20%): C = 1 + (0.2^3 * 1.0) = 1.008
Medium utilization (60%): C = 1 + (0.6^3 * 1.0) = 1.216
High utilization (90%): C = 1 + (0.9^3 * 1.0) = 1.729
Peak + High (90%): C = 1 + (0.9^3 * 1.5) = 2.094
```

## 5. OPERATIONAL COST ALGORITHM

### System State-Based Costs

```text
OperationalCost = ValidatorCost + StorageCost + NetworkCost

O(s) = V(n) + S(d) + N(b)

Where:
- V(n) = Validator network cost based on active validators
- S(d) = Storage cost based on data size
- N(b) = Network bandwidth cost
```

### Component Calculations

```text
ValidatorCost = (ActiveValidators / MaxValidators) * 0.05 ZSNAIL
StorageCost = (DataSize KB / 1000) * 0.001 ZSNAIL
NetworkCost = (Bandwidth MB / 100) * 0.002 ZSNAIL
```

## 6. COMPLETE GAS PRICE FORMULA

### Final Equation

```text
GasPriceZSNAIL = 0.29 + (0.1 * (1 + (TPS/25000)^2)) + 
                 (1 + (u^3 * w(t))) + 
                 ((v/100) * 0.05 + (d/1000) * 0.001 + (b/100) * 0.002)
```

### Simplified for Implementation

```text
P = 0.29 + 0.1(1 + (T/25000)^2) + (1 + u^3 * w) + (0.0005v + 0.000001d + 0.00002b)
```

## 7. ECONOMIC OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS

### Revenue Maximization

```text
Revenue = GasPrice * TransactionVolume * AdoptionRate

R = P * V * A

Optimize: dR/dP = 0
Solution: P* = optimal gas price for maximum revenue
```

### Market Penetration Strategy

```text
MarketShare = 1 / (1 + e^((P - P_competitive) * sensitivity))

MS = 1 / (1 + e^((P - Pc) * s))

Where:
- Pc = Competitor average price
- s = Price sensitivity factor = 5.0
```

## 8. DYNAMIC PRICING ALGORITHMS

### EMA-Based Price Smoothing

```text
PriceSmoothed(t) = α * PriceCurrent + (1-α) * PriceSmoothed(t-1)

Where α = 0.1 (smoothing factor)
```

### Adaptive Base Fee

```text
If AvgBlockUtilization > 0.8 for 100 blocks:
    BaseFee *= 1.125
If AvgBlockUtilization < 0.2 for 100 blocks:
    BaseFee *= 0.875
```

```

### Market Position Score

```text
