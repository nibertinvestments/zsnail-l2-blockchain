## ðŸ§® Core Mathematical Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Base Fee Algorithm

```python
def calculate_base_fee():
    blocks_per_day = 86400 / 2  # 43,200 blocks
    cost_per_block = $100 / blocks_per_day
    base_fee = cost_per_block * 1.2 * 0.01 * 12500
    return base_fee  # 0.347222 ZSNAIL
```

### 2. Priority Fee Algorithm

```python
def calculate_priority_fee(current_tps):
    min_priority = 0.1  # ZSNAIL
    demand_factor = (current_tps / 25000) ** 2
    return min_priority * (1 + demand_factor)
```

### 3. Congestion Multiplier Algorithm

```python
def calculate_congestion(utilization, time_weight):
    u_cubed = utilization ** 3
    congestion_cost = base_fee * u_cubed * time_weight
    return congestion_cost
```

### 4. Operational Cost Algorithm

```python
def calculate_operational_cost(validators, tps):
    validator_cost = (validators / 100) * 0.05
    storage_cost = 0.001
    network_cost = (tps / 100) * 0.002
    return validator_cost + storage_cost + network_cost
```
